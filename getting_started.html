    <section class="content-box light-blue">
      <h3>Choose the Right Instrument</h3>
      <p>If you're new, you donâ€™t need an expensive grand piano. A quality digital keyboard with weighted keys is a great place to begin. Make sure it has at least 61 keys, touch sensitivity, and a sustain pedal option if possible.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="content-box gray">
      <h3>Understand the Layout</h3>
      <p>The keyboard consists of repeating patterns of black and white keys. Learning where middle C is and recognizing the layout visually is essential for orientation. Donâ€™t worryâ€”we'll help you learn quickly.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="content-box light-blue">
      <h3>Hand Positioning Matters</h3>
      <p>Correct hand posture is key to long-term success. Keep your fingers curved and wrists relaxed. Good habits early on prevent tension and injury later. Take time to practice finger control with simple exercises.</p>
